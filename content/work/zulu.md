# Zulu Desktop

Sangoma Technologies is a leading voice and Unified Communications (UC) solution provider, award-winning cloud and on-premise UC PBX solutions. Also the primary developer and sponsor of the Asterisk project, the world’s most widely used open-source communications software, and FreePBX, the world’s most widely used open-source PBX software.

### About

Working in a global team as a frontend developer, I help to maintain the Zulu Desktop project implementing features, fixing bugs, and refactoring legacy code.

It is a client made with React for web and Electron for desktop.

We use ES6, redux, redux-thunk, jest, and shallow for development.

We use Asterisk, Socket.IO, and FreePBX for communication.

### Highlights

- Coded application improvements in an agile environment with one-week sprints
- Developed a solution for text formatting support similar to Slack
- Refactored the Dialpad container logic (the heart of the application)
- Implemented transfer call functionality
