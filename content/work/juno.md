# Juno

Juno is a way to log your childâ€™s uniqueness in an intelligent and beautiful app and print automatically designed memory books.

### About

**This was my first react-native "real-world-big-project".**

It was a personal project of a friend (Werner Hoier, CTO of Streetspotr) and his wife, who contracted me to develop it.

It is available at both Apple and Google Store.
