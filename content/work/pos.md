# POSpulse Dashboard

POSpulse is the leading crowd-based shopper insights intelligence company in Europe, providing leading industry segments with more transparency and excellence to better market their products and services. Over 800,000 shoppers and consumers generate insights along the entire customer decision journey, providing real-time feedback on the shopping experience.

### About

This was my first project in a remote job, I had great experiences, and I could learn a lot about discipline and productivity.

I did maintenance to the old dashboard and admin panel of the company.

When POSPulse and StreetSpotr were merged, while the other team members were fixing issues in the old dashboard, I had the freedom to choose the stack, structure, and everything else to start the new dashboard.

### Highlights

- Integrated POSPulse and StreetSpotr platforms on its acquisition
- Coded a new dashboard from scratch to support both companies data
- Improved platform UX with a new UI and performance improvements
- Coded improvements in older POSPulse dashboard and admin panel
