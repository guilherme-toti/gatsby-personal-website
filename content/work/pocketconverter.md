# Pocket Converter

An open source React Native application published at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

### About

**This was my first react-native released to both stores.**

It was a personal project when I was learning react-native, so I decided to do it
from beginning to end, releasing it to both [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.totipocketconverter) and [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/pocket-converter/id1504100849?ls=1).

It is open source and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/guilherme-toti/pocket-converter).
