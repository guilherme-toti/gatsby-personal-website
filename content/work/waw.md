# Work Around the World

A way to check if you match with ticket prices and weather of places you are willing to relocate.

### About

This project was made as a step for a technical interview I had with a company.

I like it and would like to add it here because it shows a bit of my skills with React.JS, Context API, and tests with Enzyme.

As the objective was to delivery it ASAP, I used TailwindCSS to delivery some beautiful in few time, so I hadn't to care so much about CSS.

It is open source and the code is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/guilherme-toti/waw).
